=======================

Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project description:
--------------------

MoDisco provides an extensible framework to elaborate on model-driven solutions supporting software reverse engineering and modernization use cases such as technical migration, software improvement, documentation generation, quality insurance, etc.

Legacy systems embrace a large number of technologies, making the development of tools to cope with legacy systems evolution a tedious and time consuming task. As modernization projects face with both technologies combination and various modernization situations, model-driven approaches and tools offer the requisite abstraction level to build up mature and flexible modernization solutions.
 - Quality Assurance: verifying whether an existing system meets the required qualities (detection of anti-patterns in existing code and computation of metrics.)
 - Documentation: extraction of information from an existing system to help understanding one aspect of this system (structure, behaviour, persistence, data-flow, change impact , etc).
 - Improvement: transformation of an existing system to integrate better coding norms or design patterns.
 - Migration: transformation of an existing system to change a component, the framework, the language, or its architecture more about MoDisco
