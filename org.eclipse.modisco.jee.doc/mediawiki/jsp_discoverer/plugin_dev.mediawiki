= JSP Discoverer API =

Each MoDisco discoverer responds to a normalized interface and can be called programmatically (see org.eclipse.modisco.infra.discovery.core.IDiscoverer<T>).

First, add the following plug-in dependencies to your project ('''Require-Bundle''' in your Manifest.MF):
* org.eclipse.modisco.jee.jsp
* org.eclipse.modisco.jee.jsp.discoverer
* org.eclipse.modisco.infra.discovery.core

You can easily discover a JSP model programmatically. For example, to discover a JSP model from a Java project:
<pre>
DiscoverJspModelFromJavaElement discoverer = new DiscoverJspModelFromJavaElement();
discoverer.discoverElement(javaProject, monitor);
Resource jspResource = discoverer.getTargetModel();
</pre>

To have a monitor to pass to the <code>discoverElement</code> method, you can either call the discoverer in an Eclipse Job, or pass a new NullProgressMonitor if you don't need progress reporting.

As an example, you may checkout the code from project org.eclipse.modisco.jsp.discoverer.tests.
