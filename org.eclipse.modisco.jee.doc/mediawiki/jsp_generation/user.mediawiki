== JSP Generation ==

The goal of the JSP Generation plug-in is to allow JSP / HTML code generation from a Java model 

''Quality disclaimer: this generator is provided without any guarantee.''

=== Description ===

[[Image:../../img/jsp/JspM2T.PNG|JSP Code Generation|frame|center]] 

This plug-in proposes [[Acceleo|Acceleo MTL]] modules for generating JSP/html files conforming to JSP models. There is only one template which generates the code.

JSP models are obtained with the [../jsp_discoverer/user.html#JSP_Discoverer JSP Discoverer] component.

=== User Manual ===

First, you need a JSP model. Please refer to the JSP Discoverer user manual.

To launch a JSP generation, Add ''org.eclipse.modisco.jee.jsp.generation'' to your plug-in dependencies and use the ''GenerateJsp'' main method with the input model and target folder as parameters. The code should look like this :
<pre>
GenerateJsp jspGenerator = new GenerateJsp(URI.createFileURI("C:/.../my.javaxmi"),
    new File("C:/.../myOutputFolder"), new ArrayList<Object>());
jspGenerator.doGenerate(null);
</pre>

Note : at the moment this documentation is written, there is no way of creating one Acceleo Launch Configuration based on one installed Acceleo module plugin.
