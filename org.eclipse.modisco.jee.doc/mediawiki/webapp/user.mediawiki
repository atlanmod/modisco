== Overview ==
Reverse engineering use cases on Java/JEE applications require the retrieval
of data, via models, for a combination of several established
technologies : Java, JSP, XML configuration files, ...

Considering old JEE based applications: some data is stored in XML
configuration files (and not as Java annotations), usually named "web.xml".
The goal of the WebApp Discoverer plug-in is to allow the extraction of information from such web.xml files.
