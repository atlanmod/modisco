= Ejb-Jar Discoverer  =

The goal of the Generic Ejb-Jar Discoverer plug-in is to allow generic extractions of information from an ejb-jar.xml file, without the need for a metamodel dedicated to a conforming Document Type Definition(DTD) or XML Schema Description (XSD). 

== Details  ==

Considering ejb-jar.xml files conforming to DTD or XSD, it will be more convenient to have some dedicated metamodels to manipulate information. However, the Generic EjbJar Discoverer is an alternative for miscellaneous ejb-jar.xml files.

This plug-in aims at analyzing any ejb-jar.xml file by providing a model describing the information found. Supported versions are JEE 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 5, and 6.

Moreover, it allows to serialize the xml file back from the model. Thus, some M2M transformation might be used jointly to upgrade some xml files. 


== User manual  ==

=== Discovering and browsing from contextual menu  ===

The plug-in provides the user with a contextual menu to easily create models. 

To create the model of your configuration file, right-click on the file in the Eclipse '''Package Explorer''' view, and select '''Discovery > Discoverers > Discover JEE ejb-jar.xml''':

A discovery parameters dialog opens to let you specify the parameters of the discovery:

* Set '''SERIALIZE_TARGET''' to true if you want to save the model to a file
* You can define '''TARGET_URI''' to the location of a file in your workspace. If it is not defined and SERIALIZE_TARGET is true, a model file will be created in the project.<br> '''Beware: the file will be overwritten if it already exists!'''

Once launched, a progress dialog will appear as soon as the operation begins. Depending on the size of your application, the reverse engineering process might take some time to complete:

At the end of the process, the newly created model file is added to the root of your project if you set SERIALIZE_TARGET to true:

And the model is opened in the default model browser if you selected '''Open model in editor after discovery''':

The EjbJar XMI files (with a filename ending in ".xml_ejbjar.xmi" by convention) can be opened in any model browser:
