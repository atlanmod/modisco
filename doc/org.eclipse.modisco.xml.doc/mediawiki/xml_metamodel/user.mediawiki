Concepts are described in [http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/ W3C XML Recommendation] (document and logical structures sections).
Concepts for Document Types Declarations are not managed here.
Note : there is no composite 'ownedAttribute' reference between Element and Attribute type to avoid ambiguous duplicate owning possibilities considering 'chidren' reference.
