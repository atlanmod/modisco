== Overview ==
This plug-in aims at analyzing project deployment files from the JEE technology. Because a lot of information is stored in those files, it seems really interesting to retrieve the most of it.

The MoDisco project proposes a set of discoverers for JEE configuration files.

Each discoverer targets a meta-model specific to the version of the discovered technology. This guarantees the integrity of the represented information.
