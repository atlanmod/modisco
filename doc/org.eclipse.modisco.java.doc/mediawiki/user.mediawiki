= Overview =
This component aims at analyzing Java source code compliant with version 3 of "Java Language Specification" from Oracle and providing a model describing the information found, conforming to the [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.java.doc/mediawiki/user.html#Java_Metamodel Java metamodel].

A Java model contains the full abstract syntax tree of a Java program: each statement such as an attribute definition, method invocation or loop is described. In addition, links between elements are resolved (by resolved link we mean for instance a link between a method invocation and the declaration of this method, or between the usage of a variable and its declaration). The model can thus be seen as an abstract syntax graph (ASG).
