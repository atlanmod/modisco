== Overview ==
'''MoDisco workflow''' provides a mechanism to initialize and launch a workflow of discoverers, generators and model transformations. These workflows are defined on top of the Eclipse platform's launch configuration mechanism.

A MoDisco workflow is created as a launch configuration, which itself consists of an ordered list of launch configurations. When launching the workflow, each launch configuration is launched in the order specified in the workflow.

== Creating a MoDiscoWorkflow  ==

=== The user interface of MoDiscoWorkflow  ===

A MoDisco workflow is defined in a launch configuration: select '''Run > Run Configurations...''' in the main menu, or click on the arrow on the '''Run''' button in the toolbar [[Image:../../img/workflow/MoDiscoWorkflow-Execution.png]] and then select '''Run Configurations...'''.

You can now build your MoDiscoWorkflow:

* Add a launch configuration to the MoDiscoWorkflow as a work item using the '''Load...''' button
* Remove a selected work item using the '''Remove''' button
* Move a selected work item up or down in the MoDiscoWorkflow using the '''Up''' or '''Down''' buttons

The workflow component provides a simple workflow engine (only sequential execution, no binding of parameters, etc.).


=== Add a work item  ===

After clicking on the "Load..." button, you must choose a launch configuration to add to the workflow:

=== Run your MoDisco Workflow  ===

When you have finished building your MoDiscoWorkflow, click on the '''Run''' button. An error window opens if one or more MoDiscoWork items are not valid. Every MoDiscoWork item must be valid in order to be able to run the MoDiscoWorkflow.

== Current limitations  ==

It is currently not possible to bind the parameters between components. Furthermore, the workflow is executed in a sequential way.
