== Overview ==
This plug-in proposes a small framework for building weaving information between code models (Java, C++, ...) and physical resources (disk files and directories). Such a weaving information is convenient for client programs in order to access physical files. 

For example, the [../model_browser/user.html MoDisco Model Browser] may use this information for displaying original code portions associated to [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.java.doc/mediawiki/user.html Java model] elements.

This plug-in is an infrastructure component and it does not provide features to the MoDisco end-user. Only the contributor and adopter communities are concerned by this plug-in.

This framework reuses the [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.infra.omg.doc/mediawiki/kdm/user.html KDM] "Source" subpackage, which proposes a model for physical resources, known as "Inventory Model".

The feature is in the scope of a larger issue: the composition of metamodels . Considering that the composition with kdm inventory metamodel is a recurrent composition case, providing a dedicated minimal framework was convenient.

The MoDisco [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.java.doc/mediawiki/composition/user.html "Java Application"] is the reference metamodel and discoverer for illustrating the use of the KDM Source extension.


== KDM.Source extension : a core metamodel for weaving Code models and KDM Inventory models ==

The component proposes a small framework for building weaving information between code models (Java, C++, ...) and physical resources (disk files and directories).

This framework reuses the [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.infra.omg.doc/mediawiki/kdm/user.html KDM] "Source" subpackage, which proposes a model for physical resources, known as "Inventory Model" (see figure [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.infra.omg.doc/mediawiki/kdm/user.html#Details here])

The KDM inventory model also proposes <code>SourceRegion</code>/<code>SourceRef</code> concepts for weaving other kdm models (kdm code models, ...) with a physical representation. Some references exist from other KDM subpackages to the <code>SourceRef</code> concept.

[[Image:../../img/kdm_source_extension/Kdmsourceregion.JPG|frame|center|KDM Source Metamodel subpart (from the KDM Specification v 1.1)]]

MoDisco proposes to compose KDM inventory models with non-KDM models. For generic reuse reasons, a new metamodel extending KDM Source has been created.

A subpart of the KDM Source model is extended for linking the <code>SourceRegion</code> concept with non-KDM elements, via the <code>ASTNodeSourceRegion</code> metaclass.

Moreover a recurrent pattern, in such a model composition, is to link a KDM <code>SourceFile</code> with a code model element. Such a link is represented with the <code>CodeUnit2File</code> metaclass.

[[Image:../../img/kdm_source_extension/Kdmsourceextension.png|frame|center|870x483|MoDisco KDM Source extension Metamodel]]

This is a core metamodel that the developer should extend for describing a composition between a specific code metamodel and kdm.source.

== How to create a composition metamodel between Code models and KDM Inventory models ==

Given a particular code metamodel (such as the Java one), MoDisco proposes to extend KDMSourceExtension to define a metamodel composition between inventory models and code models.

The <code>ASTNodeSourceRegion</code> should be subclassed, and a reference to one concrete code metaclass should "specialize" the <code>ASTNodeSourceRegion->node:EObject</code> reference (one simple way is to set the new reference as derived from the generic one).

'''''(TODO : an opposite reference should be described for allowing navigation from code elements to the <code>SourceRegion</code> instances --> waiting for facet shortcut evolution to come)'''''

In most cases the <code>CodeUnit2File</code> will be subclassed.

A reference example of such a composition metamodel is the [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.java.doc/mediawiki/composition/user.html#Java_Composition_Metamodel Java Application example].

[[Image:../../img/kdm_source_extension/Javakdmsourceregion.JPG|frame|center|Java and kdm composition metamodel (extract)]]

== How to develop a discoverer for the composition between code and KDM inventory models ==

=== Overview  ===

After describing a composition metamodel, the contributor/adopter has to write an associated [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.infrastructure.doc/mediawiki/discovery_manager/user.html discoverer]. Such a discoverer will instantiate elements for the ''composition metamodel'' described above (<code>SourceRegion</code>...) Such a discoverer will have to manipulate both the kdm.source model and the code model.

A discoverer for the related code model is a prerequisite. The [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.java.doc/mediawiki/user.html#Java_Discoverer Java Discoverer] is an example. Such a discoverer is not supposed to instantiate SourceRegion subclasses. To avoid ambiguity, we will talk about it as a "leaf code discoverer". 

The composite discoverer should, in most cases, invoke the leaf discoverers (kdm.source and code). Another way is to provide the leaf models as parameter values to the composite discoverer.

A kdm.source model can be discovered using the [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.infra.omg.doc/mediawiki/kdm/user.html#KDM_Source_Discoverer KDM Source discoverer]]. Note that such a discoverer only provides a representation of files/directories. It does not instantiate <code>SourceRegion</code> subclasses. 


A reference example of such a composition dicoverer is the [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.java.doc/mediawiki/composition/user.html#Java_Composition_Discoverer|Java Application discoverer example] (Java class <code>org.eclipse.modisco.java.composition.discoverer.DiscoverKDMSourceAndJavaModelFromJavaProject</code>). 

[[Image:../../img/kdm_source_extension/Codekdmdiscovery.JPG|frame|center|Composition discovery overview]]

=== Using the abstract AbstractComposedKDMSourceDiscoverer2 discoverer Java class ===

An abstract java class is proposed to facilitate and factorize some common code: <code>org.eclipse.modisco.kdm.source.extension.discovery.AbstractComposedKDMSourceDiscoverer2</code>.

This abstract discoverer proposes a process with four steps: 
#initialize the composite model (to implement) 
#discover the kdm.source model (already implemented) 
#discover the other leaf models (to implement). In most cases there is only one code model 
#terminate the discovery (weaving or saving actions)

Using the <code>AbstractComposedKDMSourceDiscoverer2</code> is not mandatory.

=== Instrumenting the leaf code discoverers for retrieving visited source regions ===

In most cases, code discoverers have access to the physical location of each portion of code that is modeled.

There are two ways for a composite discoverer to retrieve such information when invoking the leaf discoverer :
* subclass some leaf discoverer implementation classes.
* add a listener to the leaf discoverer to listen for source regions visit events.

The second way implies the leaf discoverer to implement the <code>org.eclipse.modisco.kdm.source.extension.discovery.ISourceRegionNotifier</code> class to support the registering of <code>org.eclipse.modisco.kdm.source.extension.discovery.SourceVisitListener</code>.

<code>ISourceRegionNotifier#notifySourceRegionVisited</code> must be called when appropriate from inside the leaf discoverer.

You may subclass the proposed abstract class <code>ISourceRegionNotifier</code> which already implements <code>ISourceRegionNotifier</code>, and inherits from <code>AbstractModelDiscoverer</code>. 

The [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.java.doc/mediawiki/user.html#Java_Discoverer Java discoverer] implementation class illustrates the application of such a pattern.

The following figure illustrates the architecture for leaf and composite discoverers related to a CSharp metamodel.

[[Image:../../img/kdm_source_extension/Csharpkdmdiscovery2.JPG|frame|center|Applicative Architecture for CSharp leaf and composite discoverers example]]

=== Instantiate source region nodes ===

Once the composite discoverer has the capability to retrieve information about source regions visited and associated code model elements, it will instantiate the <code>SourceRegion</code>.

=== Resource distribution and memory usage ===

Creating one <code>SourceRegion</code> instance for each code model element may induce some memory usage issues. Considering a given code metamodel, it may be interesting to have a strategy for dispatching model elements (from the composition model) into more than one XMI resource file. 

Thus, the EMF lazy resource loading mechanism enables opening and working with some subpart of the model.

A reference implementation for this strategy is in the 
[../../../org.eclipse.modisco.java.doc.archi/mediawiki/composition/archi.html#Benchmark Java Application discoverer].

== KDM.Source extension UI : a source code synchronization framework  ==

This component proposes a small framework for synchronizing model element with their source code. The idea is to be able to browse a model of any technology, and to have the possibility to directly navigate to its source code in the right editor.

This framework uses the [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.infrastructure.doc/mediawiki/kdm_source_extension/user.html#KDM.Source_extension_:_a_core_metamodel_for_weaving_Code_models_and_KDM_Inventory_models KDM Extension framework] which deals with weaving a model with its source code

The component exposes two extension points for providing a synchronization strategy; those extensions are to be provided for every technology a code synchronization is needed for.
[[Image:../../img/kdm_source_extension/MoDisco_SynchronizationStrategy.jpg|frame|center|Extension point for Strategies]]

An example of what the result looks like has been implemented for Java. For more information on how to use it see the [../../../org.eclipse.modisco.java.doc/mediawiki/composition/user.html#Java_source_code_synchronization Java source code synchronization user manual]

[[Image:../../img/kdm_source_extension/MoDisco-CodeSynchronizationDoubleClick.jpg|frame|center|Result of a code synchronization]]

===SourceStrategy===
This extension point aims at declaring strategies to resolve the ASTNodeSourceRegion of an element
<pre>
public interface SourceStrategy {	
   public ASTNodeSourceRegion getASTNodeSourceRegion(final EObject eObject);	
   public boolean isApplicableTo(final Notifier target);
}
</pre>

* '''getASTNodeSourceRegion''' : Generic method to retrieve the <code>ASTNodeSourceRegion</code> of an element. Each strategy has to implement this method because depending on the technology, the <code>ASTNodeSourceRegion</code> information might be contained by the element itself, or by another model such as the MoDisco Composition one
* '''isApplicableTo''' : Determines if the source object can be handled by this strategy. Each strategy has to implement this method with its own criteria (most of the time a verification of a metamodel URI will be enough)

===RevealingStrategy===
This extension point aims at declaring strategies to open the file which contains the element, and then to select it in its editor.
<pre>
public interface RevealingStrategy {
   public void revealInTextEditor(final IFile file,final SourceRegion sourceRegion);
   public void selectInTextEditor(final IEditorPart iEditorPart,final SourceRegion sourceRegion);
   public boolean isApplicableTo(final Notifier target);
}
</pre>

* '''revealInTextEditor''' : 
** Parameter file : the file detected by the <code>SourceStrategy</code>
*'''selectInTextEditor''' : select
** Parameter iEditorPart : the editor in which the selection has to be done
*'''isApplicableTo''' : Determines if the source object can be handled by this strategy. Each strategy has to implement this method with its own criteria (most of the time a verification of a metamodel URI will be enough)

===ModelBrowserListener===
This class only maps the event "doubleClick" in the browser in order to call the <code>openAndSelectEObjectInSourceFile</code> method without adding a dependency between the MoDisco Browser and kdm.source.extension.ui

===SourceAccessAdapter===
This class extends <code>AdapterImpl</code> to provide a convenient way to manage strategies (''Source/Revealing'') for a given element.
A <code>SourceAccessAdapter</code> is added to each element which has to be synchronized with its source code.  Thanks to this adapter, strategies are resolved once for an element and then stored in the adapter.

===SourceAccessAdapterFactory===
This class extends <code>AdapterFactoryImpl</code> to provide the Adapter mechanism implemented to manage extensions.

Available strategies extensions are stored in a singleton way in 2 static lists:
<pre>
private static List<SourceStrategy> listSourceStrategy;
private static List<RevealingStrategy> listRevealingStrategy;
</pre>

Then each time we need a strategy we use the singleton pattern to get it.
