KDM improvements :

EnumeratedType cannot have code elements => it should have the possibility, in Java, these feature is available (an enum is able to contain a class declaration or methods).
Enumerated value cannot have an expression, only a value => in C#, a value could be initialized with an expression, and in Java, a value initialisation corresponds to a constructor call but only with parameters list (anonymous constructor call ?)

A MemberUnit cannot contains StorableUnit elements => in Java, we could have a list of variable declared with only one type (private final Object obj1, obj2, obj3;)
A MemberUnit should be able to be contained in an InterfaceUnit (java interface may have static final attributes)

An ImplementationOf relationship should not be restrained to "abstract" methods.
