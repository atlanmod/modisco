Note: APT processing should be enabled on this project because it contains discoverers defined with Java annotations.
But it is disabled in order to avoid compilation errors in the MoDisco developer's workspace because of
test class written with wanted errors (WrongDiscoverer.java).
Annotations Control works on binary form -> do not need to activate compilation annotations controls.
