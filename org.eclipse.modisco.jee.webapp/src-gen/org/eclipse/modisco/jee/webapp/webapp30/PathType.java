/**
 * <!-- begin-user-doc -->
 * A representation of the model object '<em><b>Path Type</b></em>'.
 * <!-- end-user-doc -->
 *
 * <!-- begin-model-doc -->
 * 
 * 
 *         The elements that use this type designate either a relative
 *         path or an absolute path starting with a "/".
 *         
 *         In elements that specify a pathname to a file within the
 *         same Deployment File, relative filenames (i.e., those not
 *         starting with "/") are considered relative to the root of
 *         the Deployment File's namespace.  Absolute filenames (i.e.,
 *         those starting with "/") also specify names in the root of
 *         the Deployment File's namespace.  In general, relative names
 *         are preferred.  The exception is .war files where absolute
 *         names are preferred for consistency with the Servlet API.
 *
