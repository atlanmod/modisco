= Target Definition

A target definition files specifies all aspects of a target platform,
including its location (repositories), constituent plug-ins and environment.

For now, the only working definition is `eclipse-oxygen.target`.
All other files are used for configuration purposes.

**Caution**: do not use Eclipse to edit the `eclipse-oxygen` target file, as it will remove
all repository ids, making the local mirrors useless.
