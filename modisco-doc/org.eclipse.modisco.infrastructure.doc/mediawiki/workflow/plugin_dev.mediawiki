== Add a workflow engine in MoDiscoWorkflow ==

To extend the capabilities of MoDiscoWorkflow, other workflow engines can be provided through the "engine" extension point.

=== "engine" extension point  ===

[[Image:../../img/workflow/MoDiscoWorkflowEngineExtensionPoint.jpg|thumb|center|"engine" extension point definition]] 

The MoDiscoWorkflow plug-in proposes an extension point named "engine". 

This extension point allows you to add a new type of Workflow. To do this, you define:
* a workflow engine, specified by the "workflowExecution" element
* a workflow model item definition specified by the "workflowCore" element, to bridge the internal model representation with the MoDiscoWorkflow representation

===="workflowExecution" part====

This part defines: 
*'''class''': The class which has to implement interface "org.eclipse.modisco.workflow.core.WorkflowExecution". It will bridge a MoDiscoWorkflow definition with the internal execution engine to run the specified workflow.

==== "workflowCore" part ====

This part defines: 
*'''name''': a name that describes the workflow engine
*'''class''': a class which implements interface "org.eclipse.modisco.workflow.core.WorkflowModel". It will bridge the internal model representation with the MoDiscoWorkflow representation.
