== Launching a discoverer ==

Then, if the discoverer has input parameters, a dialog opens to let you enter these parameters:

Parameters that are marked with an asterisk are mandatory, and you won't be able to click '''OK''' to launch the discovery until you have filled them in.

Single click the '''Value''' column of a parameter to edit it. Check "Open model in editor after discovery" if you want to browse the model immediately after the discovery.

Then, click '''OK''' to start the discovery.

== Discoverers View ==

You can open a view that displays all registered discoverers : go in '''Window > Show View > Other...''' and select '''MoDisco > Discoverers''':
