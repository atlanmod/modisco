== Overview ==
The '''MoDisco Model Browser''' is a feature-rich Ecore model browser. You can use it to browse any Ecore model more easily than with the default Ecore editor. 

[[Image:../../img/model_browser/MoDiscoModelBrowser0.8.png]]

The browser surface is separated in two panes. The left one displays a list of meta-classes, and the right one shows instances of the selected meta-class (that is, model elements). 

At the top of each pane, a toolbar allows you to quickly change display options relative to that pane. 

== Features  ==

=== Links  ===

You can follow links between model elements by expanding the links tree nodes. Links appear for associations, aggregations and the EMF container. The tree representing the model is infinite. 

An icon indicates the link type, and the number of instances under the link is displayed in parentheses.

The source of the link is always its parent in the tree, and the targets are its children. 

=== Display options  ===

You can use the buttons at the top of the ''Instances'' panel to set the following options (click on the down-pointing arrow [[Image:../../img/model_browser/MoDiscoModelBrowser-View_menu.gif]] to see hidden options):

=== Meta-class list  ===

The ''Types'' panel displays all the meta-classes of the opened model, with the number of instances for each meta-class. When you click on a meta-class, its instances are displayed in the ''Instances'' panel. Multi-selection of meta-classes is also supported. 

You can use the buttons at the top of the ''Types'' panel to set the following options (click on the down-pointing arrow [[Image:../../img/model_browser/MoDiscoModelBrowser-View_menu.gif]] to see hidden options):

=== Browse  ===

Right-click on a model element and select "Browse" to select the meta-class of this element in the ''Types'' panel and display this model element amongst its siblings of the same type. You can also press '''Enter''' while an element is selected to trigger this action.

=== Navigation history  ===

When you navigate from one meta-class to another, or when you browse an instance, you can then go back and forth in navigation history by using the left and right arrows in the toolbar (or the '''Alt+Left''', '''Alt+Right''' shortcuts). 

=== Search  ===

Type some text in the search bar and type '''Enter''' to filter the currently displayed instances by name. Press '''Escape''' to restore the view. Only instances of the currently selected meta-class are filtered. 

=== Attributes  ===

Attributes of the selected element are displayed in the Properties view. To show this view, double-click on a model element or right-click and select '''Show Properties View'''.

[[Image:../../img/model_browser/MoDisco_model_browser_-_Properties_view.png]] 

You can also display attributes directly in the model tree by activating the "Show Attributes" option in the right toolbar. 

=== Accessibility  ===

The font size can easily be changed by the click of a button in the main toolbar. 

[[Image:../../img/model_browser/MoDisco_model_browser_-_font_size.png]] 

The first button makes the font larger, the second one smaller, and the third one restores the default font size. The base font is configurable in Eclipse preferences.
