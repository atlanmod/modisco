== Overview ==
Structured Metrics Metamodel (SMM) is a publicly available specification from
the Object Management Group ([http://www.omg.org/adm OMG]). Measures are comparable evaluations and, as
such, are critical to software engineering and architecture driven
modernization.
Software measurement methods produce comparable evaluations of software or
application artifacts. Counts such as number of screens, lines of code, number
of methods, etc. all quantify the size of artifacts along a single dimension... 
The goal of SMM is to facilitate the interoperability of measurements of
software artifacts.
