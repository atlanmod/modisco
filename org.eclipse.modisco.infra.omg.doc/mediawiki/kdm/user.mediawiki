== Overview ==
The '''Knowledge Discovery Metamodel''' (KDM) is a publicly available specification from
the Object Management Group (OMG). KDM is a common intermediate representation
for existing software systems and their operating environments, that defines
common metadata required for deep semantic integration of Application Lifecycle
Management tools. KDM is designed as the OMG's foundation for software
modernization, IT portfolio management and software assurance. KDM is a
metamodel for knowledge discovery in software. It defines a common vocabulary
of knowledge related to software engineering artifacts, regardless of the
implementation programming language and runtime platform - a checklist of items
that a software mining tool should discover and a software analysis tool can
use. KDM is designed to enable knowledge-based integration between tools. More
specifically, KDM uses Meta-Object Facility (MOF) to define an interchange
format between tools that work with existing software as well as an abstract
interface (API) for the next-generation assurance and modernization tools.
